Hello to all interested in Convunity! Convunity = Conversation + Community

Thank you for taking the time to explore this video chat application.

Convunity is a place where conversation meets community.

If you want to check-out the application without installing anything follow this link:
https://convunity.netlify.app/ (Convunity's Alpha version is deployed.)

    If you want to test the video chat functionality on the deployed Alpha version do as follows:

    - Sign in as "guest".
    - The password is the tricky part: The password is "ytinuvnoc" but spelled backwards.

    Once you have access on your browser, open a new browser tab or share the login info with a friend.

    Voila! You should be video chatting with someone by now.

If you want to run this app on your computer follow closely.

- Clone this repo to a local directory on your computer. This means you're taking all the code I created to your personal computer. Be nice with it.

- Next, we need to install all the nice libraries and packages I used to make this app work.
  - We will devide this step in two sections:
    - Client
    - Server
      (I was nice enough to create different directories for both so targeting them will be a walk in the park.)
